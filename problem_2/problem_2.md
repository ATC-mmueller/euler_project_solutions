# Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem 

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.  

## Solution approach

Instead of storing each entry of the Fibonacci sequence in a list, it is enough to keep track of the last two numbers and the cummulative sum of the even-valued terms.

The calculation takes less than 500µs. 
For reference: If the list of all Fibonacci entries is kept, the calculation takes well over a minute.
