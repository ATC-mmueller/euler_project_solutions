# 10 001st Prime

## Problem

By listing the first six prime numbers: 
**2**, **3**, **5**, **7**, **11** and **13**, we can see that the **6**th prime is **13**.

What is the **10 001**st prime number?

## Solution Approach

Simply run our is_prime method until we get the **10 001**st prime. 
The algorithm takes about 18ms. 

For optimization better prime detection algorithms should be implemented.
